Hello all my name is Seyna I have just transitioned into tech a year ago. 
As I grown within my career I love learning about new programming lanuages and seeing what I can create from it.
This is my second project using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an interactive simple calculator. 
I am excited to continue learning and growing not just as a Cloud Engineer but as an inspiring Software developer.
